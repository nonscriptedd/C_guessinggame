For everyone,
ATTENTION!
-You need to install the GCC C compiler and Git before starting the installation!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, clone this git repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/nonscriptedd/C_guessinggame.git

Then go in the created file so we can compile the program:

$ cd C_guessinggame

To compile the program, run:
$ gcc start.c -o ./game

To START it, run:
$ ./game

A question should show up via explanation, have fun!
